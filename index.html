                    My name is Ian Wren and I live in Seattle, WA.  I am 38 years old and was married on July 13th, 2018.  I spend my free time playing video games, making meals with my wife, and 
                    playing with my two cats, "Fox 'Spooky' Mulder" and "Drogon." I entered into a coding boot-camp through the University of Washington in August of 2020.  My goals for this boot-camp 
                    is to make a career change into something that I'm intested in and allows me to spend more time with my wife and our fur babies.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am holding the younger of the two cats, Fox, in the picture.
                    Fox was born on Feburary 17, 2019, and was adopted by my wife and I eight weeks later.  We adopted him after my wife's cat of 17 years passed away at the beginning of Feburary 2019.
                    He has been the perfect companion for my wife as she made her way through cancer treatments to beat her stage 3 breast cancer.  She is now cancer free and I am very certain that the cute little presence of Fox
                    helped her deal with the stress and fear of her treatments.  He is leash trained and enjoys walks around the neighborhood
                    and in the various parks in the Seattle area.
